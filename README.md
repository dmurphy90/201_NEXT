NEXT!

NEXT! is a way for TA’s to manage students who need assistance during lab assignments. Students put their names in the queue, specifying whether they’d prefer the next available TA or need help from a specific TA who is familiar with an existing problem. TA-specific requests will be color-coded, and each TA will have an assigned color.

Students can see their position in the queue as they move toward the top. They’ll be notified when they are second in line, and again when their turn is up. In the stretch goals, we’ll give users the ability to pause their spot in the queue for up to 10 minutes if they need to step away.

TA’s will have a separate interface and login. On their screens, they can see the same queue of students on the side and a large profile of the top student in the queue. After 1 minute at the top of the queue, TA’s will be able to Bump students down to the bottom if they don’t show up. Once the student has been helped, TA’s can click Next to see the next student on the list. TA’s will also have an Available/Away toggle so they can opt into using the tool and are not assumed available at all times.
